Alexis Garretson is a Doctoral Candidate at the Tufts University and The Jackson Laboratory joint program in Mammalian Genetics and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. Her Ph.D. research in the [Dumont Lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-dumont-lab) focuses on using genetically diverse mice and bioinformatics approaches to produce high-quality estimates of mutation rate variation in populations and relate this molecular phenotype to infertility and reproductive health. She previously completed a M.S. degree in Evolutionary Biology at George Mason University with [Dr. Rebecca Forkner](https://science.gmu.edu/directory/rebecca-forkner) using community science and herbarium specimens to investigate the impacts of climate change on the timing of plant and insect reproductive phenology. 
<br>
<br>
She is an advocate for open data through supporting data reuse, synthesis, and access and as a data specialist with [Anecdata.org](https://anecdata.org/pages/about). Alexis is also involved in bioinformatics and data science education as an instructor with The Carpentries and through developing university data science curricula.
