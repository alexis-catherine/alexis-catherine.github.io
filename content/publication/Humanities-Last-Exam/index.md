abstract: "This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence on the humanities, examining how advances in large language models influence the landscape of humanistic inquiry. By analyzing the role of AI-generated text in academic discourse, pedagogical practices, and creative expression, we evaluate the evolving relationship between human expertise and machine-generated knowledge. We present insights from case studies, experimental interventions, and expert opinions to assess the implications of AI for the future of the humanities. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges posed by automation in intellectual and creative domains."
