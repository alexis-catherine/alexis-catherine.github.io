abstract: "Understanding the gene regulatory mechanisms that govern plant development requires precise, cell-type-resolved insights into transcription factor binding. In this study, we present a comprehensive atlas of conserved transcription factor binding sites across diverse flowering plant species. Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we mapped the gene regulatory networks at an unprecedented resolution, revealing key transcriptional programs that define cell identities. Our findings provide a foundational resource for investigating conserved and species-specific gene regulation, with implications for plant development, stress response, and crop engineering."
