## About Me

I am a Doctoral Candidate in the Tufts University and The Jackson Laboratory joint program in Mammalian Genetics and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. My PhD research in the [Dumont Lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-dumont-lab) uses genetically diverse mice to investigate mutation rate variation and its relationship to infertility and reproductive health. 

Before starting my PhD, I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Evolutionary Biology at George Mason University, where I investigated the impacts of climate change on plant and insect reproductive timing. Beyond research, I am dedicated to bioinformatics education, serving as an instructor with The Carpentries and contributing to university-level data science curricula.
