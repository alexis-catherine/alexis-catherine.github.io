EDI successfully completed its second Summer Fellowship Program (10 June – 9 August 2019). We supported nine fellows at host sites located in different parts of the country, studying a large variety of ecosystems, with the host institutions differing in size and data management resources. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data for long-term data preservation (securely archived with a unique digital object identifier – doi), making the data discoverable (in the EDI repository, DataONE and by internet searches) as well as to fulfill the requirements of scientific journals and funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation. We also supported the development and publishing of a workflow for marine image analysis.

My dataset on amphibian breeding was highlighted as EDI's featured data contribution.
