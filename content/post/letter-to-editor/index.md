I recently wrote a **letter to the editor**, published in the *Bangor Daily News*, highlighting the risks of **cutting climate-related funding** and its potential harm to **Maineâ€™s environment and economy**.  

ðŸ”— **Read the full letter here**: [Bangor Daily News: Cutting Climate-Related Funding Will Harm Maine](https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/02/16/opinion/letters/letter-cutting-climate-related-funding-will-harm-maine-joam40zk0w/)  

As scientists and policymakers debate the future of climate initiatives, itâ€™s critical to advocate for **evidence-based decision-making** that supports sustainability and local communities. Maine is already seeing the effects of **rising sea levels, warming waters, and ecosystem shifts**, making continued investment in climate research and mitigation essential.  

Engaging with **public discourse on science policy** is an important part of advocacy, and I encourage others to raise their voices on these crucial issues.
