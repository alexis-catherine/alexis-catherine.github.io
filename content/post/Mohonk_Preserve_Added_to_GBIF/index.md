 The Mohonk Preserve is a land trust and nature preserve located in New Paltz, New York. The mission of Mohonk Preserve is to protect the Shawangunk Mountains region and inspire people to care for, enjoy, and explore their natural world. To accomplish its mission, Mohonk Preserve conducts programs in four key areas: conservation science, environmental education, land protection, and land stewardship. The Daniel Smiley Research Center (DSRC) – Mohonk Preserve’s conservation science unit – is recognized nationally and beyond for its extensive collection of long-term research data, including 86 years of natural and cultural history observations, over 120 years of daily weather data, 60,000 physical items, 9,000 photographs, and research library. Of those physical items, there are over 3,000 herbarium specimens, 139 mammal specimens, 107 bird specimens, 140 butterfly specimens, 400 arthropod specimens, and over 10,000 index cards with handwritten and/or typed natural history observations. The data and natural history collections support the Preserve’s land management and stewardship activities and our educational programming. In addition to the physical collection, ecological monitoring continues through citizen science engagement and dedicated staff effort. Our long-term research is networked with other sites studying environmental change indicators and provides a strong and unique underpinning of ecosystem management and an understanding of changes in the world around us. As an important biological field station and living laboratory, our data helps us and others to predict, manage, and adapt to a rapidly changing environment using sound science to support decision making.
