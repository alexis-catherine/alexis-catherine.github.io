Iâ€™m honored to share that I have been selected as an **eLife Community Ambassador**, joining a global network of **107 early-career researchers** committed to promoting **scientific integrity, open science, and inclusive research practices**.  

The **eLife Community Ambassador program** is an initiative designed to empower early-career researchers to drive positive change in **peer review, reproducibility, and research culture**. As part of this program, I will work alongside fellow ambassadors to advocate for **transparent publishing, open data, and equitable research opportunities**.  

ðŸ”— **Read the announcement**: [eLife Community Ambassadors: 107 Early-Career Researchers Join the Programme](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/2db39138/elife-community-ambassadors-107-early-career-researchers-join-the-programme)  

This is an exciting opportunity to **contribute to the future of scientific communication**, and I look forward to collaborating with this incredible cohort of researchers!
