 While at-home COVID tests may be convenient, their results often go unreported. But now, through my collaborator Dr. Jane Disney and I, Mount Desert Island's Biological Laboratory has a new program designed to track them.<br><br>
 We were interviewed by News Center Maine about the project, and how individuals across the state of Maine and around the world can participate. Watch or read the interview [here](https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/health/mdi-biological-lab-tracing-at-home-covid-test-results-health-community/97-c8b9f570-2068-46fe-80c7-10f0db6642e0)<br>
