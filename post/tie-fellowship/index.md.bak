The TIE Environmental Research Fellowship program, which supports and funds projects across disciplines, provides graduate students at Tufts the opportunity to conduct independent and interdisciplinary environmental research. This is an opportunity for students to explore topics relating to their focus area and obtain mentorship from Tufts faculty and TIE staff to help build expertise.

Their funding supports my work with Anecdata.org and the Community Environmental Health Laboratory.
