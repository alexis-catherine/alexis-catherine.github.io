      <title>46 Questions</title>
      <link>https://alexis-catherine.github.io/post/46-questions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists* are characterized over and over again by the same few stereotypes: that we’re anti-social, disinterested in society, and work-obsessed. But these negative stereotypes are harmful on so many levels. They feed into negative ideas of science and scientists and actually influence how messages are received outside of the scientific community. The narrow presentation of scientists as being only from certain genders, races, backgrounds, and career trajectories also influences who enters STEM fields, and who stays there. We know how important representation and inclusivity are, and we want to broaden the heck out of them in our field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We here at 46 Questions want to elevate the voices of underrepresented peoples in science-oriented careers and to foster a sense of community in the sciences. We want to showcase the diversity that makes us strong and to make scientists more relatable at the same time, both to the rest of the world and to each other. How? Easy: we hit scientists with 46 rapid-fire questions, they answer, and we share the results. It’s quick, painless, and hopefully fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Unique Scientist</title>
      <link>https://alexis-catherine.github.io/post/unique-scientist/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are a team of scientists striving to encourage the celebration of diversity in science by highlighting the journeys of #UniqueScientists from all over the world. The #UniqueTeam is fueled with a passion to highlight the diverse faces and stories of scientists that give their heart and soul every day for a better future. Our mission is to embrace diversity and share the #UniqueJourney of any scientist who wishes to share their tale with the world. And, that is exactly what you will find on here: stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost daily, you will find on spotlight a brand-new journey. The story of a unique scientist who has shared a little bit about their lives with the hope to inspire current and future generations to follow their dreams. Our vision is to create an atmosphere that helps others realize that their self-identity should never be a determining factor in the career you choose. #UniqueScientists is more than a group of scientists sharing their stories. #UniqueScientists is a movement and a force that welcomes the journey of every scientist and uses it to empower a brighter future.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mercatus Joseph Schumpeter Fellowship alum Alexis Garretson (GMU ’18) chose to study biology because she likes thinking about complex systems, and was originally drawn to George Mason University because of its partnership with the Smithsonian. Alexis graduated in 2018 with a major in Biology and minors in Public Health, Global Conservation, and Economics. After finishing the first year of her master’s degree at Brigham Young University (BYU), she returned to Mason to complete her MS in Biology, concentrated in Evolutionary Biology.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ESIP Community Fellow and M.S. student, Alexis Garretson, reflects on her summer fellowship with the Environmental Data Initiative, an ESIP Partner Organization, and how the Data-at-Risk Matrix in development by the ESIP Data Stewardship Committee aided her in this work.

      <title>EDIs Featured Data Contribution</title>
      <link>https://alexis-catherine.github.io/post/edis-featured-data-contributions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EDI successfully completed its second Summer Fellowship Program (10 June – 9 August 2019). We supported nine fellows at host sites located in different parts of the country, studying a large variety of ecosystems, with the host institutions differing in size and data management resources. Each fellow made a significant contribution to publishing the host site’s data for long-term data preservation (securely archived with a unique digital object identifier – doi), making the data discoverable (in the EDI repository, DataONE and by internet searches) as well as to fulfill the requirements of scientific journals and funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation. We also supported the development and publishing of a workflow for marine image analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dataset on amphibian breeding was highlighted as EDI&amp;rsquo;s featured data contribution.

      <title>SGCI Science Ambassador</title>
      <link>https://alexis-catherine.github.io/post/sgci-science-ambassador/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 18:01:46 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alexis-catherine.github.io/post/sgci-science-ambassador/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SGCI has launched a new program to create a network of representatives who would like to share information about gateways on their campuses, in their organizations, and in distributed projects. Gateway Ambassadors serve as community builders, making connections and creating a network between people, experts, and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gateways Ambassador community will be built with the goal of learning from peers about new technologies and a way to share information and best practices. We&amp;rsquo;ll plan periodic webinars and face-to-face meetings at conferences and have also set up a Gateway Ambassadors Google Group and encourage all involved to contribute to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Arctic Vegetation and Avenues for Herbarium-Driven Research</title>
      <link>https://alexis-catherine.github.io/post/arctic-summer-college-talk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Herbarium specimens can be used for more than documentation of occurrence and can help support broad investigations into the impacts of climate change on arctic vegetation.
