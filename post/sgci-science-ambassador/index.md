SGCI has launched a new program to create a network of representatives who would like to share information about gateways on their campuses, in their organizations, and in distributed projects. Gateway Ambassadors serve as community builders, making connections and creating a network between people, experts, and resources.
 
The Gateways Ambassador community will be built with the goal of learning from peers about new technologies and a way to share information and best practices. We'll plan periodic webinars and face-to-face meetings at conferences and have also set up a Gateway Ambassadors Google Group and encourage all involved to contribute to the conversation.
