abstract: "ABMs are typically constructed and implemented in computer simulation environments, and can then be used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the overall behavior. One simulation environment is NetLogo: An open source and free multi-agent programmable modeling environment. It was created in 1999, and has been in continuous development ever since. Today we will be using the NetLogo environment to investigate evolution and natural selection using a few of the built-in teaching models."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This laboratory exercise introduces students to modeling in ecology and evolution through the agent-based modeling environment NetLogo."
