I was selected to receive the AIM-AHEAD (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity (AIM-AHEAD) and NIH National Center For Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) Training Program. This is an intensive 8-month program in advanced data analysis developed by National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and utilizing the resources of the NCATS N3C Data Enclave and AIM-AHEADâ€™s data science training core.  Completing the training will equip the motivated professional to conduct the in-depth analysis of large datasets essential for cutting-edge biomedical and socioeconomic research.
