I was invited by the American Geophysical Union's Thriving Earth Exchange program to become a Community Science Fellow in the Science, Policy, and Engagement Cohort funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.


Community science is becoming an area I'm more and more passionate about, and I'm excited to continue building my expertise in supporting particularly indigenous and underserved communities in developing scientific infrastructure to support their goals, whether those are related to advocacy, policy, elder knowledge preservation, or other ways of supporting more autonomy and recognition of communities within broader scientific knowledge.
