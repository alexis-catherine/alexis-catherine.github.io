The Community Environmental Health Laboratory at MDI Biological Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine engages community members as citizen scientists in collecting environmental data. In addition, students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate-level receive training in a variety of environmental monitoring methods and are involved in research projects at the municipal, state, and regional levels. One of our primary projects, Anecdata.org, is a free online citizen science platform developed by the Community Environmental Health Laboratory at the MDI Biological Laboratory. Anecdata.org is used by hundreds of individuals and organizations to gather and access citizen-science observations and provides a platform to easily collect, manage, and share their citizen science data.
