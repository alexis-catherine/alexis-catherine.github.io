During a really fantastic summer graduate internship at the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, mentored by Dr. Sharon Greenblum, I learned about processing single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) data and writing standardized workflows. I specifically worked on integrating data from diverse organisms and using that data to understand shared developmental and biological processes.
