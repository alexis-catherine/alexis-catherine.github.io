I am excited to be attending *The Whole Scientist* Short Course, a four-day NIH-funded program designed to help emerging scientists develop key professional, interpersonal, and communication skills. This program, hosted at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) in Farmington, Connecticut, offers hands-on training through seminars and workshops led by experts in the fields of leadership, management, and communication.

The course is targeted at Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scientists looking to advance their careers in various scientific fields, from academia to industry. Participants will gain invaluable insights into areas like leadership, mentoring, and team dynamics—skills that are essential for becoming successful leaders in biomedical and basic science research.

The program also fosters collegial peer relationships and offers the potential to meet RCR training requirements. I’m looking forward to gaining new perspectives and networking with fellow scientists from across the country.
